<p>The grease pencil tool (that basically allows you do draw in the 3D space) upgraded in blender 2.8 was of great use to draw details on surfaces. I learned a lot from analysing <a href="https://cloud.blender.org/p/gallery/5e46a80442fa9613e1cd1fca">Dedouze‚Äôs 2.82 splash screen file</a>.</p>

<p>For the smoke I used an emitter with particles rendered as spheres, textured with the same ‚Äútoonish‚Äù custom material. I also used a blend texture on particles to animate the scale of these spheres along their lifetime. Added buoyancy, wind, turbulence and tweaked it quite a lot.</p>

<p>The project was initially to model a small flying city and have this boat float around‚Ä¶ That may be for another time.</p>
