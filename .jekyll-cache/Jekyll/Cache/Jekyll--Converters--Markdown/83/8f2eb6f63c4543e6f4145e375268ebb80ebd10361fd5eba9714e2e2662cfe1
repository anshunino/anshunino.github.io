    <figcaption>3-Home: They had built their home on an old pylon. From up there you could see even more red rocks than down below. This was also a great place for more antennas to scan for wavy space stuff.</figcaption>

    <figcaption>7-helper: Living on a desert planet gives you time to learn stuff - stuff like breaking and fixing coffee machines. A spaceship could be considered as a big flying coffee machine of some sort.</figcaption>

    <figcaption>10-Forest: As Ek and Och were flying through a bunch of asteroids, they thought to themselves that they had gone a long way just to see more rocks. These rocks were less reddish though.</figcaption>

    <figcaption>11-Creatures: Amongst the non-reddish rocks, some pirates were carefully scraping a ship‚Äôs wreckage. Ek and Och flew past them as they did not even notice. Also they were quite bored of these lifeless rocks.</figcaption>

    <img src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/022/066/003/medium/jules-mabon-12-someone.jpg?1574002066" style="width:100%" />
    <figcaption>12-Bump into someone: Suddenly a huge ship went crashing through the asteroids in front of Ek and Och. This massive automated administrative ship was transporting some space-paperwork and did not mind anything on its way.</figcaption>

    <img src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/022/066/004/medium/jules-mabon-13-cabin.jpg?1574002069" style="width:100%" />
    <figcaption>13-Cabin in the woods: After a long flight through the non-red lifeless boring rocks, Ek and Och stumbled upon an old space-diner. It was a good thing because they were hungry. Sadly they noticed as they approached that it was abandoned.</figcaption>

    <img src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/022/066/002/medium/jules-mabon-15-leaflet.jpg?1574002075" style="width:100%" />
    <figcaption>15-Mysterious omen: Ek found an old leaflet on one of the dusty tables. It presented some shiny temple on a planet not that far away. That would be less boring than space-rocks.</figcaption>
    </center>

    <img src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/022/073/564/medium/jules-mabon-16-landing.jpg?1574023832" style="width:100%" />
    <figcaption>16-Old Ruins: It turned out that the flyer was as old as the temple was. So old that the building was more rubble than temple. Anyway, that would be less boring than space-rocks.</figcaption>
    </center>

    <img src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/022/073/566/medium/jules-mabon-17-ambush.jpg?1574023836" style="width:100%" />
    <figcaption>17-Attack: It‚Äôs a trap ! The pirates had been following them since panel 11 ! It was time for a fight.</figcaption>

    <img src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/022/073/567/medium/jules-mabon-18-loot.jpg?1574023841" style="width:100%" />
    <figcaption>18-Loot: The pirates were not too hard to scare off, one of them somehow left its gear while running away. Among it Och found a brand new glowing powercell. This was a useful thing to power radios, coffee machines or recursive auto-wobblers.</figcaption>
    </center>
</figure>

    <img src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/022/073/568/medium/jules-mabon-19-stolen.jpg?1574023845" style="width:100%" />
    <figcaption>19-Pitfall: The attack was a diversion : while the two pirates were fighting, their nasty colleagues were grabbing Ek and Och‚Äôs ship! Ek could only watch them leaving with their now damaged ship and most of their stuff - even their precious cheese.</figcaption>
    </center>
</figure>

    <img src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/022/073/597/medium/jules-mabon-20-rain.jpg?1574023948" style="width:100%" />
    <figcaption>20-Rain: Ek and Och managed to build a tent from the few items they had left. They seemed to be stuck here and were quite sad to have lost their new ship and tasty cheese (that was still waiting for them in the ship).</figcaption>
    </center>
</figure>
<figure>

    <img src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/022/073/600/medium/jules-mabon-21-hope.jpg?1574023952" style="width:100%" />
    <figcaption>21-Hope: The next day, as Ek and Och were searching for anything that could help them out of this cheese-barren place, they stumbled upon a big metal door with a sign saying ‚ÄúGalb√ºrkkh‚Äù. That could roughly translate to ‚Äúspaceship hangar‚Äù or ‚Äúshoebox‚Äù</figcaption>

    <img src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/022/073/601/medium/jules-mabon-22-artifact.jpg?1574023957" style="width:100%" />
    <figcaption>22-Artifact: Once the door opened, a long corridor lead Ek and Och to a ‚Äúdead‚Äù robot. ‚ÄúDead‚Äù was a strong word for a machine that simply ran out of battery, but after all that‚Äôs what it looked like.</figcaption>
    </center>

    <img src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/022/073/604/medium/jules-mabon-23-summoning.jpg?1574023962" style="width:100%" />
    <figcaption>23-Summoning: Hopefully the powercell Och salvaged from the pirates was compatible with the USB-Z-9001 protocol and thus could be connected to the robot. The robot was quite happy about that, for being out of battery is quite boring.</figcaption>
    </center>

    <img src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/022/073/637/medium/jules-mabon-24-armor.jpg?1574024074" style="width:100%" />
    <figcaption>24-Armor: Once the robot had heard about Ek and Och‚Äôs adventures, he thought to himself that he would like some of that cheese too. He promised them a brand new ship in exchange for a piece of the delicious thing.</figcaption>
    </center>
</figure>

    <img src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/022/073/639/medium/jules-mabon-25-ability.jpg?1574024078" style="width:100%" />
    <figcaption>25-Ability: It appeared that the robot‚Äôs memory was quite outdated. The promised ship had indeed been replaced by an old piece of junk. Hopefully the piece of junk was still able to fly.</figcaption>
    </center>

    <img src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/022/073/641/medium/jules-mabon-26-team.jpg?1574024082" style="width:100%" />
    <figcaption>26-Team Up: Once the space-junk-ship was running, Ek, Och and the robot devised a 4 step plan to recover the cheese. 1- take-off, 2- shoot the pirates 3- recover the cheese 4- cheese party</figcaption>
    </center>

    <img src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/022/073/643/medium/jules-mabon-27-wounded.jpg?1574024087" style="width:100%" />
    <figcaption>27-Wounded: As this story needs not to be too long since the illustrator is lazy, things went exactly as planned : they took off, the pirate ship was shot.</figcaption>
    </center>
</figure>
<figure>
  <center>
    <img src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/022/073/658/medium/jules-mabon-28-lost.jpg?1574024158" style="width:100%" />
    <figcaption>28-All is lost: Once their ship was shot, the pirates were quite embarrassed since the only thing they could do now was drifting aimlessly through space until someone finds them. Hopefully they had packed some board games.</figcaption>
    </center>
</figure>
<figure>
  <center>
    <img src="https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/022/073/661/medium/jules-mabon-29-pickup.jpg?1574024163" style="width:100%" />
    <figcaption>29-Pick up the pieces: The robot was chosen to go fetch the cheese : it was indeed the critical part of the plan, needing uttermost care and precision and also, robots happened to not have the need to breathe (still they are able to enjoy food).</figcaption>
    </center>
</figure>
<figure>

    <img src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/022/073/662/medium/jules-mabon-30-battle.jpg?1574024167" style="width:100%" />
    <figcaption>30-Final battle: The last step of the plan did not go as planned: they did not plan who was to get the first piece of cheese. They could have fought to death, but they rather decided to do a rock-paper-scissors to pick the winner.</figcaption>

    <figcaption>31-Return Home: Their belly full of tasty dairy product, Och, Ek, and the robot set sail back home to tell their funny adventure.</figcaption>
