<p>I am a PhD student at INRIA Sophia-Antipolis in France. I am studying Stochastic Geometry for Multiple Object Detection and Tracking in High Resolution Multi-Source Data Sets with Josiane Zerubia as my supervisor in partnership with Airbus Defense and Space. I graduated in 2019 from Ecole Centrale de Lille (France) in Computer Science/Machine Learning.</p>

<p>I also sometimes make art that may end up in the <a href="/crea/"><strong>creative projects</strong> section</a>.</p>
