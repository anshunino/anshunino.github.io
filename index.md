About
====================

<img src="img/me.png" alt="drawing" width="180px"/>

I am a PhD student at INRIA Sophia-Antipolis in France. I am studying Stochastic Geometry for Multiple Object Detection and Tracking in High Resolution Multi-Source Data Sets with Josiane Zerubia as my supervisor in partnership with Airbus Defense and Space. I graduated in 2019 from Ecole Centrale de Lille (France) in Computer Science/Machine Learning.

I also sometimes make art that may end up in the [**creative projects** section](/crea/).
